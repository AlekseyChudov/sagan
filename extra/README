These are simple example's of Sagan "external" plug-ins.  That is,  they are
programs Sagan calls externally.  Data is passed from Sagan to the external
program via stdin.  The 'external' program can then do anything you want 
with the data.  

sagan-gtk	- Displays a GTK/X11 "popup" window of a Sagan alert.  
sagan-notify	- Uses the libnotify X11/GTK function to create a temporary 
		  "popup" message.
