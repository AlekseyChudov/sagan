# Standard _required_ Sagan options!
##############################################################################

# Sagan can read log entries via a FIFO (First In,  First Out) or via 
# 'standard input' (stdin).   If this option is _present_,  then Sagan assumes
# log entries will come in via a FIFO.  If this option is _not_ present,  then
# Sagan will 'assume' log entries will come in via stdin.   
#
# When Sagan takes input from stdin,  syslog-ng calls this via the 'program' 
# mode/call. 
#
# The --program flag can override this variable and force Sagan to use 
# stdin. 
#
# [optional] - Depending on system configuration.

var FIFO /var/run/sagan.fifo

# This variable contains the path of the Sagan rule sets.  It is required.

var RULE_PATH /usr/local/etc/sagan-rules

# Where Sagan should store it's lock file. 

var LOCKFILE /var/run/sagan/sagan.pid

# This is for storage of Sagan runtime information.

var SAGANLOG /var/log/sagan/sagan.log

# Where Sagan should store alerts,  in a text file format. 

var ALERTLOG /var/log/sagan/alert

# This is the IP address _of_ the Sagan system.   These options are used
# if Sagan is unable to determine a TCP/IP network address and/or port.
#
# [Required]
  
sagan_host 192.168.0.1
sagan_port 514

# If logging to a Snort/Prelude database,  and the rule set specifies the
# protocol as # "any",  this is the protocol we default to.  This is only
# needed if you are # logging to a Snort/Prelude database. 
#
# [Defaults to 17 [UDP],  which is what normal 'syslog' traffic is.  If you
# want TCP to be the desired effect,  change this option to "6". 

; sagan_proto 17

# Disable DNS warnings.  Sagan will warn every time it has to do a DNS lookup
# when attempting to normalize a log entry.  You typically don't want to
# do DNS lookups with the log analysis.  More information can be found at:
# https://wiki.softwink.com/bin/view/Main/SaganDNS.  If it's not possible
# to gather the true TCP/IP address information,  you can supress these 
# warnings here.

# Sagan "sensor" configuration.  If you plan on running Sagan and storing data
# to a Snort database,  these options are required.   This information gets 
# logged to the Snort database's "sensor" table to differentiate  between Snort
# IDS/IPS data and log data.   We don't really have an "interface", so we create
# one known as "syslog",  or what ever you'd like to call it.

# [Required if logging to a Snort database]

# If you plan on logging to a Snort database,  this is where you tell Sagan 
# where to log to.   The options should be pretty clear.  Currently Sagan 
# supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.  The "maxdb_threads" is the maximum number of
# threads that can be created.  This defaults to 20.

# External program/system calls configurations specifics
##############################################################################

# This option calls an external program when an event is triggered by a rule.
# Sagan basically makes a thread and calls the execl() system call.
# Data is supplied to the program being called via standard in (stdin). 
# Data can be sent in a "parsable" or "alert" format.   "parsable" will be
# probably easier for your external program to parse. 
#
# The "max_ext_threads" limits the amount of threads that can be created, 
# which defaults to 20.

; max_ext_threads 50
; output external: /home/champ/stdout parsable

##############################################################################
# libesmtp (SMTP/E-mail) specific configuration options
##############################################################################

# If you'd like Sagan to e-mail events to you,  then you want to enable this
# this option.  The fields should be pretty self explanatory.  
# "max_email_threads" is the maximum number of threads that can be created 
# for e-mailing out events.  This defaults to 20.  If min_email_priority is 
# set,  then Sagan will _only_ e-mail event equal to or less than the 
# minimum priority.   If left commented out or set to '0',  Sagan will
# e-mail all events.

##############################################################################

# If you'd like Sagan to log information to a Logzilla database (MySQL or
# PostgreSQL),  then you'll need to enabled this option.  The 
# "max_logzilla_threads" option specifies the maximum number of threads that
# can be used to log to a Logzilla database.  This defaults to 20.

# Prelude (IDMEF) output plug in
##############################################################################

# This lets Sagan output to the Prelude security framework.  This allows 
# Sagan events to be viewed in the Prelude "Prewikka" console.  The Prelude
# framework is useful in corelating events from multiple sources.   Prelude
# uses fhe Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) format,  which
# also might be useful.

##############################################################################
# Unified2 output plug in 
##############################################################################

# This lets Sagan log the Snort's 'Unified2' output format.  This allows 
# events generated by Sagan to be read and queued for external programs 
# like Barnyard2 (http://www.securixlive.com/barnyard2/).  Barnyard2 can 
# the record events in various formats (Prelude,  alert_fast,  log_ascii, 
# log_tcpdump,  Sguil,  MySQL,  PostgreSQL, ODBC, MS-SQL and Oracle). 

# output unified2: filename snort.alert, limit 128, nostamp

# Sagan syslog "Sniffier" mode.  (PLOG). Promiscuous syslog injector
##############################################################################

# This lets Sagan "listen" on a network interface via pcap/bpf and "suck"
# up UDP syslog messages.  When it "finds" a syslog message within a packet,
# it injects it into /dev/log.  Basically,  it 'sniffs' syslog messages and
# injects them to your syslog daemon (for archival purposes) and Sagan
# (for analysis).  Good for environments you can't reconfigure syslog
# services.   For more information,  see src/sagan-plog.c.

# "normalize" (extract useful information out of) log messages.  These rules
# are loaded in a dynamic method.  That is,  rather than load all these 
# at run time,  they are loaded 'as needed' by the Sagan rule sets.  These
# get triggered by the 'normalize:' flag within a Sagan rule.
