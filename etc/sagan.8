.SH NAME
sagan \- Real-time System & Event Log Monitoring System
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sagan
.RI [ options ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B sagan
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBsagan\fP is a multi-threaded, real time system- and event-log monitoring
system, but with a twist. Sagan uses a "Snort" like rule set for
detecting malicious events happening on your network and/or computer
systems.
.br
If Sagan detects a potentially bad event, that event can be stored to a
Snort database (MySQL/PostgreSQL), send it to a SIEM tool like Prelude,
or send an email.
.br
Sagan is meant to be used in a "centralized" logging environment, but
will work fine as part of a standalone Host IDS system for workstations.
